\section{Results}
As the user gets into our system, the world around him is reconstructed as he moves his head around. The user can walk around freely in this reconstructed environment as is tracked as he moves around. In addition to the reconstruction of the real world, he sees dynamic virtual characters that are aligned to the real world. Figure \todo[inline]{add image without virtual content} shows the experience without the virtual content and figure \todo[inline]{add image with virtual content} shows the experience with the virtual content.
