\section{Related Work}
Our work is most related to the idea presented by \cite{izadi2011kinectfusion} that KinectFusion can allow for more realistic "Geometry Aware" Augmented Reality where virtual objects could be overlaid on the reconstruction of the real world. In the past Depth Cameras have been used in spatial augmented  reality for overlaying the a mesh of the real world on the environment and modifying it through interaction \cite{wilson2010combining}.\\
Our generation of virtual content relies on deforming the virtual model. This is achieved through the use of dual quaternion blending \cite{kavan2008geometric}.
